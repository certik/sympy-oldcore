SymPy for Debian
----------------

Web page of SymPy: http://code.google.com/p/sympy

This package contains the sympy Python package, so in Python you can do

import sympy

and it will just work. It also contains the 

isympy

program, that is basically just a python/ipython shell, that imports the
frequently used commands. It's highly recommended for playing with SymPy. See
"man isympy" for more info.
