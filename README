1. Documentation and usage
--------------------------

Everything is at:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Documentation

If you don't want to read that, here is a short usage:

From this directory, start python and:
>>> from sympy import Symbol, cos
>>> x=Symbol('x')
>>> e=1/cos(x)
>>> print e.series(x,10)
1+1/2*x^2+5/24*x^4+61/720*x^6+277/8064*x^8+50521/3628800*x^10

Sympy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the
classic python console (or ipython when available) that loads the
sympy namespace and defines three symbols: x, y, z.

To start it issue:

  ./bin/isympy

from this directory if SymPy is not installed or simply

  isympy

if SymPy is installed somewhere in your PATH.


3. Tests
--------

to execute tests, run

python setup.py test

in the current directory.  You need to have py.test installed.


4. How to install py.test
-------------------------

If you use Debian, just install the python-codespeak-lib. Otherwise:

Execute in your home directory:

svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/py/dist py-dist

This will create a "py-dist" directory in you home dir. Add this line to
your .bashrc:

eval `python ~/py-dist/py/env.py`

Now you can call "py.test" from anywhere.


5. How to generate documentation
--------------------------------

You must have epydoc installed (http://epydoc.sf.net), version 3.0. 
Unfortunately, if you use Debian, there is only 2.1 in the unstable and it
doesn't work, so you need to download and install it by hand.

Once you have a working copy of epydoc, execute from sympy's directory: 

epydoc --config doc/apidoc.conf

6. How to create a Debian package
---------------------------------

First install these packages: cdbs, debhelper, fakeroot, docbook2x

Then issue:

python setup.py build_dpkg

This will create a python-sympy Debian package in the parent directory.
