0. Download
-----------

svn checkout http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sympy


1. Documentation
---------------

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Documentation

Examples are at:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Examples

Other documentation and examples are avaiable in the generated 
api reference, which can be viewed at 
http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/api/index.html and via python's 
help command 

See also the "TODO" file for things which are still missing.


2. Usage
--------

From this directory, start python and:
>>> from sympy import Symbol, cos
>>> x=Symbol('x')
>>> e=1/cos(x)
>>> print e.series(x,10)
1+1/2*x^2+5/24*x^4+61/720*x^6+277/8064*x^8+50521/3628800*x^10

Sympy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the
classic python console (or ipython when available) that loades the
sympy namespace and defines three symbols: x, y, z.

To start it issue:

  ./bin/isym.py

from this directory if sympy is not installed or simply

  isym.py

if sympy is installed somewhere in your PATH


3. Tests
--------

to execute tests, run

py.test

in the current directory.  You may need to install py.test.


4. How to install py.test
-------------------------

Execute in your home directory:

svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/py/dist py-dist

This will create a "py-dist" directory in you home dir. Add this line to
.bashrc:

eval `python ~/py-dist/py/env.py`

Now you can call "py.test" from anywhere.

If you use Debian, just install the python-codespeak-lib.


5. How to generate documentation
--------------------------------

You must have epydoc installed (http://epydoc.sf.net), version 3.0. 
Unfortunately, if you use Debian, there is only 2.1 in the unstable and it
doesn't work, so you need to download and install it by hand.

Once you have a working copy of epydoc, execute from sympy's directory: 

epydoc --config doc/apidoc.conf
