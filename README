0. Download
-----------

svn checkout http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ sympy


1. Documentation and usage
--------------------------

Everything is at:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/wiki/Documentation

If you don't want to read that, here is a short usage:

From this directory, start python and:
>>> from sympy import Symbol, cos
>>> x=Symbol('x')
>>> e=1/cos(x)
>>> print e.series(x,10)
1+1/2*x^2+5/24*x^4+61/720*x^6+277/8064*x^8+50521/3628800*x^10

Sympy also comes with a console that is a simple wrapper around the
classic python console (or ipython when available) that loads the
sympy namespace and defines three symbols: x, y, z.

To start it issue:

  ./bin/isympy

from this directory if SymPy is not installed or simply

  isympy

if SymPy is installed somewhere in your PATH.


3. Tests
--------

to execute tests, run

python setup.py test

in the current directory.  You need to have py.test installed.


4. How to install py.test
-------------------------

If you use Debian, just install the python-codespeak-lib. Otherwise:

Execute in your home directory:

svn co http://codespeak.net/svn/py/dist py-dist

This will create a "py-dist" directory in you home dir. Add this line to
your .bashrc:

eval `python ~/py-dist/py/env.py`

Now you can call "py.test" from anywhere.

5. Clean
--------

To clean everything (thus getting the same tree as in the svn):

python setup.py clean
