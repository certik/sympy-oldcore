- limits: ln(w)=-x ..., see page 111. write a test case and implement
  make the series expansion more robust - and fix the horrible thing in
  ln.series().

- printing: 2+-x

- go through the series expansion and make sure the correct amount of terms are
  being generated.

- add plus and minus infty, sign(x) doesn't work for -infty...

- problems with expressions like (sqrt(2)+1)/3, it is a number in fact, but
  not a class "number". look through all the assertions isinstance(rational),
  and consider changing it to "not has(e,x)", or rather "not e.has(x)".

- implement evalf() and implement <>, i.e. 0< ln(3)/ln(2)-1, at the beginning,
  use evalf() for the comparison.

- amd64 evaluates exp(-ln(3))^(-1) == 3 as False. fix it.
  exp(ln( ... )) helps. maybe we can use it in the fix
